# Transform Farm Game to Clicker Game with Evolving Plants

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Modify ClickerScreen to display a single evolving plant instead of simple button
- [x] Add growth progress bar (0-100%) for current plant
- [x] Implement click growth: each click increases progress by growthPerClick
- [x] Add idle growth: plant grows automatically over time based on idleRate
- [x] Add harvest mechanic: when progress reaches 100%, harvest for coins + XP, unlock next crop
- [x] Implement crop evolution: sequence of crops (Grass -> Wheat -> Tomato -> etc.)
- [x] Add plant levels: each crop has 5-10 levels with upgrades
- [x] Add combo growth: rapid clicks activate temporary multiplier (e.g., 2x for 10s)
- [x] Add automation: buy auto-farmers that periodically boost growth or auto-click
- [x] Update upgrades to affect growthPerClick, idleRate, unlock costs, etc.
- [x] Add prestige system: reset for "Seeds of Power" to boost future runs (threshold: 100k coins, scales up per prestige)
- [ ] Balance costs, rates, yields for engaging gameplay
- [ ] Add visual feedback: animations, sounds, combo indicators
- [ ] Test all mechanics: clicking, idle, harvest, unlock, upgrade, combo, automation
- [x] Fix remaining errors in other screens (inventory, quests) if needed
